# iTMB plotting of Cancer Types and Samples

i-TMB plot is a density plot, the height of the plot at a specific point represents the probability density at that point. A higher density value indicates a higher concentration of data points around that particular value, while a lower density value suggests fewer data points in that region. The interpretation can be simplified as follows: When a patient's TMB score is 15 with a density of 0.02, it suggests that there are 2% of patients with a TMB score of approximately 15 in the dataset.

#### ** The clinical outcomes of patients with cancer can vary significantly across different geographies, highlighting the complexity of utilizing TMB as a predictive immunotherapy biomarker.
#### ** It is important to recognize that assuming a universal criterion and cutoff for all ethnicities and geographical areas may have adverse effects on cancer patients. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting TMB data, considering the diverse factors that influence its efficacy as a biomarker in clinical settings.
